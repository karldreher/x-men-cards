# x-men-cards

This is a frontend experiment.  No infringement on trademarks is intended.


## How to
This app expects a set of cards, appended with ('-f.jpeg') and ('-b.jpeg'), in a folder public/img/<cardset>/.  <cardset> corresponds with a name of a "set".

With this condition met, the app will display all sets on the front page and then display the cards in a fun way.
